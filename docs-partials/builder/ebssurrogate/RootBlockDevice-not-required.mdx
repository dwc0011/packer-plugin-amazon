<!-- Code generated from the comments of the RootBlockDevice struct in builder/ebssurrogate/root_block_device.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `source_device_name` (string) - Source Device Name

- `device_name` (string) - The device name exposed to the instance (for
  example, /dev/sdh or xvdh). Required for every device in the block
  device mapping.

- `delete_on_termination` (bool) - Indicates whether the EBS volume is
  deleted on instance termination. Default false. NOTE: If this
  value is not explicitly set to true and volumes are not cleaned up by
  an alternative method, additional volumes will accumulate after every
  build.

- `iops` (int64) - The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) that
  the volume supports. See the documentation on
  IOPs
  for more information

- `volume_type` (string) - The volume type. gp2 for General Purpose
  (SSD) volumes, io1 for Provisioned IOPS (SSD) volumes, st1 for
  Throughput Optimized HDD, sc1 for Cold HDD, and standard for
  Magnetic volumes.

- `volume_size` (int64) - The size of the volume, in GiB. Required if
  not specifying a snapshot_id.

- `image_method` (string) - Whether to create or register the AMI image. When set to create
  the root volume is detached and swapped with the volume specified
  by SourceDeviceName before the image is created.  All volume metadata is retained.
  When set to register, the root volume is snapshotted and used when registering the image.
  Volume metadata is not retained.  Both methods detach any ommitted volumes.
